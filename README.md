# robot-rig
This is a Blend file for Blender 2.79 and a corresponding Blender addon that adds specialized controls to the character rig.

More specifically, this is a character rig I created which I also wrote a blender addon for which adds some custom controls to the rig, allowing the user to easily position and animate the rig. The addon also makes use of a custom operator I wrote that allows the characters feet to instantly be replanted onto the ground.
