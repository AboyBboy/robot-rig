# robot-rig
This is a Blend file for Blender 2.79 and a corresponding Blender addon that adds specialized controls to the character rig.

More specifically, this is a character rig I created which I also wrote a blender addon for which adds some custom controls to the rig, allowing the user to easily position and animate the rig. The addon also makes use of a custom operator I wrote that allows the characters feet to instantly be replanted onto the ground.

To use this rig and addon, first download and save the blend file and open it in Blender 2.79(other versions not tested).
After doing this, download and save the zip file, then open the user settings menu in blender and click on Add-ons.
Click Install Add-on from File, then navigate to where the zip file was saved and click open.
Once you have done that, search for 'robot' in the search box on the top-left and then click the check box next to 'Robot Rig Controls'.
There should now be a tab on the left-hand panel of the 3d-view that says 'Rig'. This contain the controls for the rig.
Note that you need to have the 'Robot Rig' selected and be in pose  mode  for the controls to work as they are supposed to.
Note also that not all of the visible parameters on the panel actually affect the rig due to some bone constraints I've placed on the rig.
I don't yet know how to only have the usable parameters be on the panel as Blender seems to treat them as a package deal.
I may come up with a workaround for this but for now it is what it is. Enjoy.
